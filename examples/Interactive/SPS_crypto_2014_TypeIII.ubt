sample V,W.

input [V,W] in G1.

oracle o1(M:G2) =
  sample R;
  return [ R ] in G1,
         [ R, M*V + R^2 + W] in G2.

win (wM:G2, wR1:G1, wR2:G2, wS:G2) = (forall i: wM <> M_i /\ wR1 = wR2 /\ wS = V*wM + wR1*wR2 + W).

proof.

coeff(1) 2.
coeff(V) 2.
coeff(W) 2.
coeff(R_i * R_j) 3.
coeff(R_i^2) 3.
simplify.
